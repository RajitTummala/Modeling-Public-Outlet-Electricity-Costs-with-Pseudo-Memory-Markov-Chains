# Modeling Electricity Costs from Public Outlet Usage through a Battery-Adjusted Pseudo-Memory Markov Chains
This code uses altered Markov Chains to predict the expected hours of usage for a public outlet given certain assumptions and based on the number of devices ('numOfDevices') over a certain period of time ('days'), reiterating ('numOfTrials') for more accurate results.
