# Modeling Electricity Costs from Public Outlet Usage through a Battery-Adjusted Pseudo-Memory Markov Chains
---
This code uses altered Markov Chains to predict how many hours a public outlet was used based on the number of devices ( `numOfDevices` ) over a certain period of time ( `days` ), reiterating ( `numOfTrials` ) for more precise results.

Don't worry if some of the terms in the title seem alien to you, we will hopefully go over each one here:
